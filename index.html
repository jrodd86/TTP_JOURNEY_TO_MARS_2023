<!--
  Choose Your Own Adventure was a very popular series of books that allowed the reader to make decisions and turn to various sections of the book, creating their own plot.

  Your task is to create a version of Choose Your Own Adventure in HTML. You will primarily use the <img> tag to show images and the <a> tag to link between pages. Each new page in the story will have to be its own html page. You can use this project as an example.

  See what adventures you can create!
